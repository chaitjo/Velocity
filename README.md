# Velocity
Velocity is a 2D arcade game made in C++ using the graphics.h library. Players control a red and blue coloured car dashing through a never ending highway, and must dodge the striped barriers by switching lanes till they eventually crash. A timer is used to calculate the score. To increase difficulty, the ‘velocity’ of the car keeps increasing when it attains scores which are multiples of 25.

This was a project for my highschool CS course. We were restricted to working with the ancient TurboC++ compiler, hence some of the code may be redundant now! However, the concepts demonstrated in coding a simple 2D game are still relevant.

# Instructions
1. Place all the files from the Velocity folder into the BIN folder of your local TurboC++ directory.
2. Compile hs_file.cpp using TurboC++ to create the empty highscores database file (Compiling hs_file.cpp again will clear the highscores in the database).
3. Compile main.cpp using TurboC++ to play the game.
